When I started this bootcamp, I did not know what to expectother than my career is going to be moved to the next level.
I had indeed put in alot of study time to learning the programming languages that interested me, but getting to the next 
phase(gaining commercial experience) seems to be a drag.
I jumped at the opportunity of enroling into this bootcamp knowing fully well thatit was an opportunity served on a 
platter of gold. Four weeks down the line, I see it as one of the best decisions I have made regarding my career.
How has the journey been?
I will sum it up as wonderful.
it did not come with its challenges, but like all challenges it can make one or break one.
What challenges did I face?
Well, there have been some aspects of my learning I swept under the rug, hoping it will not crop up.
